              <b>Born on 15th October 1931 at Rameswaram in Tamil Nadu,</b> Dr.
              Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, specialized in Aeronautical
              Engineering from Madras Institute of Technology. Dr. Kalam made
              significant contribution as Project Director to develop India's
              first indigenous Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which
              successfully injected the Rohini satellite in the near earth orbit
              in July 1980 and made India an exclusive member of Space Club. He
              was responsible for the evolution of ISRO's launch vehicle
              programme, particularly the PSLV configuration. After working for
              two decades in ISRO and mastering launch vehicle technologies, Dr.
              Kalam took up the responsibility of developing Indigenous Guided
              Missiles at Defence Research and Development Organisation as the
              Chief Executive of Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme
              (IGMDP). He was responsible for the development and
              operationalisation of AGNI and PRITHVI Missiles and for building
              indigenous capability in critical technologies through networking
              of multiple institutions. He was the Scientific Adviser to Defence
              Minister and Secretary, Department of Defence Research &
              Development from July 1992 to December 1999. During this period he
              led to the weaponisation of strategic missile systems and the
              Pokhran-II nuclear tests in collaboration with Department of
              Atomic Energy, which made India a nuclear weapon State. He also
              gave thrust to self-reliance in defence systems by progressing
              multiple development tasks and mission projects such as Light
              Combat Aircraft.
